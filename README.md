# Cadre-Land
Cadre Land is an imaginary virtual world full of interesting areas to explore related to digital media art and technology. Viewers venture through this artificial world and discover virtual objects created by the CADRE Student Organization and the Digital Media Art Program at SJSU. The world to explore and it's inhabitants are an expression of these communities to the outside world.
